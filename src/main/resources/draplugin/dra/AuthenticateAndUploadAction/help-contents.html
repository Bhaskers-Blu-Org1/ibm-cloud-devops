<div>
    The result file should contain results in the format specified above. This path will be relative to the root directory.

    For example, in a simple NodeJS project we have stored our source code in the ./src directory, our tests in the ./test directory, and our test results in the ./test/results directory. If Working Directory is blank, the Result File Location for our mocha file would be ./test/results/mochaTestResults.json. If the Working Directory field was set to ./test, our Result File Location would just be ./results/mochaTestResults.json. Also it has wildcard support. You may use environment variables
    Test results file must be in JSON format for Mocha, KarmaMocha, Istanbul and BlanketJS. Test results must be XML format for xUnit
    If you don't use any test tools/format, you can leave this field empty and we will upload a simple test report based on the job status
